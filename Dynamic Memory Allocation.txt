In case of static memory allocation there are some drawbacks like-wastage of memory, less flexibility, permanent allocation of variables etc. To overcome these situations the concept of dynamic memory allocation has been introduced.

In dynamic memory allocation the memories can be allocated dynamically at run time. To allocate memory dynamically the dynamic memory allocation technique has been introduced. It has many advantages.
Allocation of memory: In static memory allocation the variables are allocated permanently hence a wastage of memory is occurred, But in case of dynamic memory allocation the variables are get allocated until the program unit gets inactive. Memory allocation occurs during runtime.
Efficiency: The efficiency of dynamic memory allocation is more than static memory allocation and it is very flexible also.
Memory reusability: The previously used memory can also be reused in dynamic memory allocation, a function named “free” is used to release the memory for future use when the user need it.
Reallocation of memory: In static memory allocation after a memory is allocated we can’t change its size. But in dynamic memory allocation using the “realloc()” function we can change the memory block size as per our requirement.
